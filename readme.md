# Batch Creator 2

This is the source code for Batch Creator 2 (Alpha 4) which was a Delphi application I wrote many years ago. It is intended to make it easier for a user to write and maintain DOS batch files. The project is for Delphi v2.

## History

I created Batch Creator, and Batch Creator 2 whilst I was learning to program when I was in my teens. The code in this project as written between 1998 and 1999. Although I made both versions available on the internet as freeware, Batch Creator only made it as far as a Beta version, and Batch Creator 2 only made it to Alpha stage.

I seem to recollect that one of the versions even made it onto a cover disk for a computer magazine in Germany, although I can't remember which one.

## Warranty

I wrote this code as teenager many years ago. I make no warranty for the code quality, the stability, appropriateness for purpose, or any warrany or guarantee of any kind. You download and execute this code at your own risk.

## Finally....

Please don't take this code as a reflection of my current coding abilities :-)
